Important Version Compatibility:

1. Python Vesion 3.11 (Important)
4. OpenCV (Contrib version 4.8.0.74)
5. Numpy (Version 1.26.4)

 All the versions mentioned above should me followed. A specific bug will arise when using EasyOCR. 
   To solve the following bug:
 1. open directory containing EasyOCR package in Python Directory and open file named 'easyocr.py'.
 2. in top import line look for the line contaning 'from bidi.algorithms import ....' and replace 
     the word 'bidi.algorithm' with just bidi and save the file.
